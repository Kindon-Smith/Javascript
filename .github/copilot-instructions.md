# Personal Dashboard Project - Development Roadmap

This project is building a customizable personal dashboard with multiple widgets using React, TypeScript, and Vite. The goal is to showcase modern JavaScript development patterns and API integration skills.

## Project Goals & Learning Objectives

- Master React component composition and state management
- Practice TypeScript for type safety and better DX
- Integrate with multiple external APIs
- Implement responsive design and modern UI patterns
- Learn data persistence with local storage
- Practice modern development workflows

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development
- **Styling**: CSS Modules or styled-components (TBD)
- **State Management**: React Context + hooks
- **APIs**: Weather, News, Quotes services
- **Storage**: localStorage for user preferences

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation & Layout âœ… IN PROGRESS
**Goal**: Create the basic structure and responsive grid system

#### Task 1.1: Design the Grid System
- [ ] Research CSS Grid vs Flexbox for dashboard layouts
- [ ] Create responsive grid that works desktop â†’ mobile
- [ ] Plan widget sizing and arrangement strategy
- [ ] Consider: Should widgets be resizable? Draggable?

#### Task 1.2: Build Main Layout Component  
- [ ] Create header with app title and navigation
- [ ] Design main content area for widgets
- [ ] Add sidebar or footer if needed
- [ ] Plan theme switching infrastructure

#### Task 1.3: Create Reusable Widget Container
- [ ] Build base widget component with common features
- [ ] Include: title, loading state, error state, refresh button
- [ ] Plan widget props interface and styling system
- [ ] Consider accessibility and ARIA labels

### Phase 2: Core Widgets
**Goal**: Build individual functional widgets with real data

#### Task 2.1: Weather Widget
- [ ] Research weather APIs (OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI)
- [ ] Build current weather + forecast display
- [ ] Handle geolocation and API key management
- [ ] Add error handling for API failures and location issues

#### Task 2.2: Todo List Widget  
- [ ] Create CRUD operations (add/edit/delete/toggle)
- [ ] Implement localStorage persistence
- [ ] Add filtering (all/active/completed)
- [ ] Consider: Categories? Due dates? Priority levels?

#### Task 2.3: Clock/Time Widget
- [ ] Display current time, date, timezone
- [ ] Update in real-time with proper cleanup
- [ ] Consider multiple timezone support
- [ ] Handle component unmounting and memory leaks

#### Task 2.4: Quick Notes Widget
- [ ] Simple textarea with auto-save functionality
- [ ] localStorage persistence with debouncing  
- [ ] Consider: Basic formatting? Multiple notes?
- [ ] Handle large text and performance

### Phase 3: External Data Integration  
**Goal**: Connect to real APIs and handle dynamic data

#### Task 3.1: News Feed Widget
- [ ] Integrate with news API (NewsAPI, Guardian)
- [ ] Display headlines with images and descriptions
- [ ] Add category filtering and refresh
- [ ] Handle rate limits and error scenarios

#### Task 3.2: Quote of the Day Widget
- [ ] Find quotes API or create local dataset
- [ ] Display inspirational quotes with authors
- [ ] Add favorites and category filtering
- [ ] Consider: Daily rotation? User submissions?

#### Task 3.3: Social Media Feed (Optional)
- [ ] Integrate with Twitter/Reddit/GitHub APIs
- [ ] Display recent posts in clean format
- [ ] Handle authentication if required
- [ ] Consider privacy and content filtering

### Phase 4: Customization & Settings
**Goal**: Make dashboard personalized and configurable

#### Task 4.1: Settings Panel
- [ ] Create modal/sidebar for configuration
- [ ] Widget toggle (show/hide widgets)
- [ ] Theme switching (light/dark mode)
- [ ] Export/import settings functionality

#### Task 4.2: Widget Customization
- [ ] Drag-and-drop widget rearrangement
- [ ] Widget resizing in flexible grid
- [ ] Color themes and widget-specific settings
- [ ] Save layout preferences to localStorage

#### Task 4.3: User Preferences Storage
- [ ] Centralized settings management
- [ ] Import/export functionality
- [ ] Reset to defaults option
- [ ] Handle settings migration/versioning

### Phase 5: Polish & Enhancement
**Goal**: Professional touches and performance optimization

#### Task 5.1: Error Handling & Loading States
- [ ] Implement error boundaries
- [ ] Create skeleton loaders for better UX
- [ ] Handle offline scenarios gracefully
- [ ] Add retry mechanisms for failed API calls

#### Task 5.2: Animations & Interactions
- [ ] Smooth transitions for loading and interactions
- [ ] Hover effects and micro-interactions
- [ ] Respect user motion preferences
- [ ] Optimize animation performance

#### Task 5.3: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement React optimization (memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- [ ] Lazy load widgets and API data
- [ ] Minimize API calls with caching
- [ ] Bundle analysis and optimization

#### Task 5.4: Mobile Responsiveness
- [ ] Ensure great mobile experience
- [ ] Touch interactions and mobile-specific features
- [ ] Test across different screen sizes
- [ ] Consider PWA capabilities

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Create custom hooks for API calls and state logic
- Keep components small and focused on single responsibility
- Use proper error boundaries and loading states

### API Integration
- Always handle loading and error states
- Implement proper caching to reduce API calls  
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Add retry logic for failed requests

### State Management
- Use React Context for global app state
- Keep widget state local when possible
- Persist user preferences in localStorage
- Consider state normalization for complex data

### Performance Considerations
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Lazy load non-critical features

## Current Status
ðŸš§ **Phase 1 - Task 1.1**: Researching grid layout system

## Quick Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server (http://localhost:5174)
- `npm run build` - Create production build
- `npm run lint` - Check code quality
